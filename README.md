# SpitFix for WoW Classic
A simple 'fix' for the removal of /spit's use on targets
This addon will simply replace /spit with "/me spits on *target*" when a unit is targeted. <br>
If used on a player, they will **NOT** see **"*player* spits on me"** but will instead see **"*player* spits on *their_character*"**
